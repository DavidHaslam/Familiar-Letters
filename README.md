# Familiar-Letters
*Familar Letters* by **Robert Murray M'Cheyne** (1813-43)
- These letters were written during 1839 to family members and friends during his travels for the **Mission of Inquiry to the Jews**.
- My transcription of this work was done in October/November 2001 and were originally intended to have been published in my old website.
- That intention was never fulfilled before the [domain](http://web.ukonline.co.uk/d.haslam/) was shutdown in early 2011 when **Sky** closed its subsidiary **UK Online**.

## RTF format
- The uploaded files are in **Rich Text Format**.
- **RTF** is stored as text files with file extension **.rtf** that can be inspected with any ordinary text editor.

## Transcription notes
- Omitted from the transcription were some short OT scripture quotations that he wrote in **Biblical Hebrew**.
- *cf. 2001 was well before I learned to use **Unicode**.*
