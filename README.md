# Familiar-Letters
*Familar Letters* by [Robert Murray M'Cheyne](https://mcheyne.info/) (1813-43)
- These letters were written during 1839 to family members and friends during his travels for the **Mission of Inquiry to the Jews**.
- My transcription of this work was done in October/November 2001 and was originally intended to have been published in my old website.
- That plan was never completed before the [site](http://web.ukonline.co.uk/d.haslam/) was shutdown in early 2011 when **Sky** closed its subsidiary **UK Online**.

## RTF format
- The uploaded files are in **Rich Text Format**.
- **RTF** is stored as text files with file extension **.rtf** that can be inspected with any ordinary text editor.
- This file type can be opened for editing with **WordPad** or **MS WordÂ®**, etc.
- **Letter01.rtf** had somehow been corrupted. It is reconstructed by saving from **Letter01.htm** dated 2001-11-11.

## MarkDown format
- Each RTF file has recently been converted to **MarkDown** format using a [Free Online RTF to MD Converter](https://products.groupdocs.app/conversion/rtf-to-md#) and saved in the MD folder.
- There are a few character level conversion artefacts in most of these MD files that still need to be fixed.

## Transcription notes
- Letters 21 to 25 were not transcribed in 2001, so these are not yet available here.
- Omitted from the transcription were some short OT scripture quotations that he wrote in **Biblical Hebrew**.
- *cf. 2001 was well before I learned to use **Unicode**.*

## License
- **Familiar Letters** is Public Domain.

## Project status
- Incomplete - see my transcription notes above.
