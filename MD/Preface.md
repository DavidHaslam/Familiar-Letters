PREFACE

Several of these Letters were published in the Missionary Record in the year 1839, and the substance of the whole, in a more expanded form, has long been before the public in the “*Narrative of a Mission of Inquiry to the Jews,*” published by Messrs M‘Cheyne and Bonar, in 1842.  Nothing absolutely new, therefore, is now offered to the public in these pages.  Nevertheless, it has seemed good to the Editor to preserve, in a connected form, these brief sketches of a journey so interesting, and of which the results may be so important.

Adam M‘Cheyne, W.S.

Edinburgh, 1*st May* 1848.
