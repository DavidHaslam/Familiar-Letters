LETTER III.

*TO* THE SAME.

MY DEAR FATHER, MOTHER, 		**BOULOGNESURMER,**

AND SISTER,		*12th April, 1839.*

You will be happy to know that I and my interesting friends are now safe in the first town of *la belle France.* We left London last night at 7 o'clock, and arrived here this forenoon at 11. The Wednesday after I wrote to you was a day of much business and bustle to all of us in London. We all breakfasted with Sir Robert Inglis, who was very kind, and gave us many directions. We visited Mr Waghorn and Lord Ashley, the latter a most interesting young man, who is deeply interested in the cause of Israel. I saw Miss Teed at Kensington ; bade adieu to several people, and dined at Sir George Grey's. Lord Glenelg, Lady Varney, Arthur Kinnaird, and other great people, were present. Many were kind to me ; still I was thankful to get away. Slept at 21 Berners Street.

*Thursday, April 11*   Not having obtained our passport, we could not sail as we intended from the Tower Stairs in the morning. I bade goodbye to my kind friends at Hampstead ; and having made some purchases, and all ready, we set off in the Dover coach at 7 evening; all four inside. We were very happy all night conversing in all foreign tongues, and cheering one another about Israel.

At 6 this morning we came to Dover; breakfasted, and at halfpast 7 were sailing away from the white cliffs of Albion. The sea was very pleasant, and I watched retiring England till I could scarcely see it; and France, with its undulating shore, attracted our gaze in an opposite direction. At eleven we sailed into the harbour of *Boulognesurmer a* clean pretty town. We have gone all about it, and seen all its wonders. We talk French as well as we can. I am thankful to say that I feel almost quite well. The palpitation being very slight.

We have had a Jew with us, a most interesting character, of whom more hereafter. Tomorrow we go by diligence to Paris. I can add no more. We are all well. May God bless and watch over you. We feel much that God. is opening the way. Your affectionate son,

ROBT. MURRAY M'CHEYNE.
